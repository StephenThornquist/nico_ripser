# Analyses for Niko

Here's a demo script to parse the analyses and run `ripser` on the data.

## Installation

I use `uv` for environment management, which is nice because it has lockfiles to
ensure reproducible version control. However, the package itself should build
just fine with just the `pyproject.toml` using `pip`. The two build strategies
are described here:

### `uv`

TODO:


### `pip`

First clone the github repository onto your machine:

`git clone <>`
